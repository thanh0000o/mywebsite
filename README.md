This website — thanhlambeets.com — is my personal corner of the internet 🌐 and an experiment in learning by doing.

I was inspired by Neocities-style websites and the charm of the early 2000s web 💾🖱️: messy, playful, and deeply personal. Instead of following a traditional coding path, I learned the basics of HTML and CSS through Codedex 📘 and by spending a lot of time inspecting existing Neocities websites 🔍. 
I dove into their source code, explored how things were built, and slowly pieced together how layouts, styles, and interactions worked 🧩.

I also used AI tools like Claude 🤖 to help explain concepts and unblock me when I got stuck, but the learning itself was hands-on and experimental 🧪. 
I’m not a computer engineer 👨‍💻🚫, and this project isn’t meant to be technically perfect or “pure” in the traditional sense.

It’s a learning project 🌱, a creative outlet 🎨, and a throwback to the feeling of sitting behind an old computer screen late at night 🌙💡, building something just because you can.

This site is very much my own.
Welcome to my slice of the web ✨
